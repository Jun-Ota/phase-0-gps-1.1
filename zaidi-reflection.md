#Reflection on GPS 1.1

##What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
The concepts all generally made sense. The biggest piece for me was bring the theoretical to life. I'm sure it will soon be second nature but I'll require some repetition before that's the case. Simple things like:
* command syntax
* which branch to be on when merging
* how to work in a repo someone else created
* etc. (yes those bullet points are gratuitous...practicing mark down!)

##What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
* How requests / updates work when you're in someone else's repo
* How to handle a  merge conflict. Less scary than it seemed! (for now)
* Reinforced how to use GitHub to collaborate
* Best practices around commit messages

##What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
* How to get out of a manual page
* How to find a pull request on GitHub
* Why committing and adding is a two-step process

##What still confuses you about Git?
Still need to work on the muscle memory piece. Also, knowing when to add commits and how best to describe them to be useful.

##How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
It was a good experience. Definitely feels slower to pair program than just do stuff yourself but I can clearly see the value. It forces you to think through things, gives you an opportunity to talk them out and as the old adage goes, two heads are better than one. Jun-ota was a great partner. He asked good questions and was very pleasant company as well.
